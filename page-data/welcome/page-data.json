We have made this website for the learning purpose for all those students out there who wanted to enhance there knowledge learning Data-Structure and Algorithms. This website contains all the data structures and algorithms in very simple way such that anyone can learn. The DS Algo will be oriented towards the language <strong>C++</strong>. But if you wanted to learn in Java, Kindly visit this <a href=\"https://utkarsh1504.github.io/DSA-Java/\">Site</a>.

Don't expect to get everything on the first try. Don't get frustrated with yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve Daily 5-10 Question.</li>\n<li>If you are solving question on plateforms like Leetcode, CodeChef, Top-Coder etc.Keep the following points in mind:\n<ul>\n<li>Don't give more than 45 mins to a Problem.(Leetcode)</li>\n<li>First Try to Solve Problem for 15 mins by Own.</li>\n<li>If you get stuck, Look for hints after trying 15 min by your own.</li>\n<li>If you unable to solve the problem check the solution, and then after few days try to solve again.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-file-issues\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#where-to-file-issues\" aria-label=\"where to file issues permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where to File Issues</h2>\n<p>We have written this kind of like blog-site for C++ and ds-algo and tried our best to not make mistakes. However when writing hours of material, mistakes are\ninevitable, both here in the grammar and in the course with the material. However We are constantly correcting the mistakes so that those of you that come later get the best material possible. If you find a mistake we'd love to fix\nit. The best way to do this is to open a pull request or <a href=\"https://www.github.com/utkarsh1504/DSA-CPP\">file an issue</a> on the GitHub repo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#prerequisites\" aria-label=\"prerequisites permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>This course requires some of the prerequisite knowledge of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic knowledge of any programming language (Like C, C++, Java, etc.). but if you don't that's completely fine. we'll be firstly going to learn <strong>C++</strong> then we'll move to data structures and algorithms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"special-thanks\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#special-thanks\" aria-label=\"special thanks permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Special Thanks</h2>\n<p>I want to say a big thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\">Brian Holt</a> for the idea of this course-site and for allowing me to use his starter.
